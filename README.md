Task for Lynk 


##Specifically
- menu button and a slide out menu
- make one of the links in the menu direct you to another page
- Do 3 stories in "top stories for you", users can upvote/downvote and read more (the full article in another page)
- Do 2 questions in "question asked", user can answer, pass and follow the question (just make the layout)
- Implement the pass function (user can undo the pass and get another chance to answer)
- Responsive so mobile and desktop browsers can view it. 

You are free to make any assumptions - just let me know what they are. Things I'm looking for are:
- Code structure / architecture 
- How you use components 
- Attention to detail
- Readability and maintainability

##Assumptions
- Eash user only can see the best answer
- All data is mocked in JSON

##Limitations
- All data is mocked in JSON
- All data will not be sotred 
- User can input answer but no function for submitting 
- Page Trend only for demonstrating "the menu direct you to another page"
- In full article page , only display a fixed article

## Command to run 
- Webpack 
- npm run dev
